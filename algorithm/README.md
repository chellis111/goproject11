# Algorithm sentence

This project contains an algorithm designed to analyze sentences. The algorithm can be used to perform various linguistic analyses, such as identifying parts of speech, detecting sentiment, and more.

## Installation

To use this algorithm, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chellis111/goproject11.git
cd goproject11/algorithm
go get ./...
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the algorithm:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "goproject11/algorithm"
)

func main() {
    sentence := "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    analysis := algorithm.Algorithm_sentence(sentence)
    fmt.Println(analysis)
}
```
